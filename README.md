Wine Quality Analysis Project README
This README file contains information on the steps taken in the Data Science pipeline for the Wine Quality Analysis project. The aim of the project is to explore the relationship between various independent variables and the target variable (wine quality), and build models to predict wine quality based on these variables.

# Data Acquisition
The dataset used for this project was obtained from Data.World's Wine Quality Dataset (https://data.world/data-society/wine-quality-dataset). The dataset contains separate CSV files for red and white wines, with information on several wine properties.
Data Preparation
Combine Red and White Wine CSVs: Merge the two separate CSV files for red and white wines into a single DataFrame, adding a new column called wine_type to indicate whether each observation corresponds to a red or white wine.

Check Column Data Types: Ensure that each column's data type is appropriate for the data it contains. If necessary, convert columns to appropriate data types.

Investigate Missing Values: Identify and handle any missing values in the dataset. Possible strategies include dropping rows with missing values or filling in the missing values using appropriate methods (e.g., mean, median, or mode).

Investigate Outliers: Examine the dataset for any outliers and determine the best course of action to handle them, such as removing or replacing them.

# Data Exploration
Explore Variable Interactions: Investigate the relationship between independent variables and the target variable (wine quality) using visualization techniques (e.g., scatter plots, box plots) and statistical testing (e.g., correlation coefficients, ANOVA).

Clustering Analysis: Use clustering techniques to explore the data and determine whether the clusters provide any meaningful insights. Perform the following steps:

Test at least three combinations of features for clustering.
Use statistical testing and visualization methods to support your conclusions about the usefulness of the clusters.
Draw a conclusion on whether the clusters are helpful or not.
Modeling
Model Creation: Develop at least four different models for predicting wine quality. Each model should have a distinct combination of algorithm, hyperparameters, and features.

# Model Evaluation: Compare the performance of the different models using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error).

# Data Splitting Best Practices: Follow best practices for data splitting, such as splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets, and using cross-validation techniques to ensure model generalizability.

After completing these steps, analyze the results and draw conclusions about the performance of the models and the relationships between the independent variables and the target variable (wine quality). Document your findings and share your insights with relevant stakeholders.
